    <p> <mark> The results of an online Myers-Briggs test </mark>: My personality type is: Defender (I can only have more for myself by giving it away to others)
    </p>
    <p> <mark> The results of an online learning style test </mark>: Tactile (I learn by touching and doing. I understand and remember everything through physical motion. I am a "hands-on" learner who likes to touch, move, build or draw what I learn and I tend to learn better when there is some kind of physical activity involved.)
    </p>
    <p> <mark> The results of one further online test of your choosing </mark>: Based on the Big Five's assessment, my score is based on the five main aspects of personality: Openness, Consciousness, Transcendence, Consensus and Neuroscience. However, Openness accounts for the highest proportion in the remaining 4 characteristics. It says I'm an open-minded person who likes to play with ideas and explore new experiences. Moreover, the results also show me that I am a person who avoids the unknown and follows traditional ways </p>

    <p> <b> Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269): </b> </p>
    <p>Hi, I am Nghia, a Vietnamese currently studying at RMIT University Vietnam. My student ID is s3818269 and my email is s3818269@rmit.edu.vn. At present, I have a part time job as an English tutor for some primary and secondary school students. In my free time, I usually read novels, play computer games or watch films. My favorite genre of movies is horror, especially films from Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. I also love dogs, especially pugs. My IT interest came from the movie named Hackers, which I found very amazing and inspiring. Currently I only know a little about MySQL and Python, which I learnt from RMIT. Our group chose the name &ldquo;Beginner Guys&rdquo; because we are freshmen of IT field and we still have a lot of knowledge to learn and experience.</p>
    <p><strong><strong>Team profile:</strong></strong></p>
    <p>The result of Myers - Briggs Types Indicator test shows that I will focus more on internal thoughts, moods and feelings rather than on external sources of stimulation. I also have some plans for the future, but they can be influenced by the suddenly changed feelings and other people&rsquo;s criticism. These can heavily affected to my behavior in a team.</p>
    <img src="capture1.jpg">
    <p>The result of Learning style test shows that I am good at learning through hands - on experience and watching other people&rsquo;s work. By doing work repeatedly, I can gain experience from mistakes and be better. On the other hands, my least preferred learning style is auditory. This can be very bad when working in a team. I can easily miss some important information when the team leader announces the working schedule or discusses about the working plan.</p>
    <img src="capture2.jpg">
    <p>The result of Big Five Personality test shows that I am an abstract thinker, a flexible but easily sidetracked person. According to the result, I am also trustworthy, helpful and vulnerable to stress. In a team, I can make a working plan clearly and help other team members with their works. But when works do not go as plan, I am often stress out myself and then I make mistakes.</p>

The previous job idea I chose was IOS developers. There are two main groups of skills of my ideal jobs are general skills and IT-specific skills.
On the one hand, general skills in IOS developer needed key requirements such as good communication skills in English and working experience in iOS development.
On the other hand, IT-specific skills in IOS developer requirements such as working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, architectures, trends, and emerging technologies. As for the required programming languages, there are Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <font color="red"> How do the ​IT-specific skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</font> </li>
<p> The requirement of the iOS developer recruiter is to have experience with working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, emerging architecture, trends and technologies. Besides, the requirement for minimum languages to do it on the iOS platform is Objective - C and Swift, HTML5 and C ++.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> How do the​ general skills​ in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?
</font> </li>
<p> The general skills of an iOS developer should have key requirements such as good English communication skills and experience working in the iOS development field.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> What are the three highest-ranked ​IT-specific skills​ which are not in your required skill set?
</font> </li>
<p> Based on the Burning Glass Data table from May, 2017 to March 2018, there are 3 highest ranked programming languages based on Australian statistics: SQL, Java Script and Microsoft Windows. All three languages above are not included in the job requirements I selected.
</p>
<li> <font color="red"> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
</font> </li>
<p> After looked at the burning glass data, I decided to change my idea job because based on the statistics from May 2017 to March 2018, all the language required of the idea job I was selections are not at the top of the selected language. Although communication skills make up the highest percentage of general skills, I find that it can only really work if my required language has the same level of influence. In addition, learning a language for the IOS platform is a unique request of the employers so it is possible to limit the ability to work in the future.

<p> <b>Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269)</b> </p>
<p>My ideal job that I chose is Software Developer, which is about analyzing the given tasks and then coming up with the solutions. From the 2018 chart, it is crystal clear that it is not the most demanding job that business companies want to hire.</p>
<img src="capture4.jpg">
<p>The general skills which Application Developer needs to have are communication skills, problem - solving skills, team work and creativity. From the chart below, communication skills are in first rank because the Architect needs to talk to the clients as well as co-workers to gain information and ideas. Problem - solving skills rank second and creativity rank ninth because the job requirement is to create the solutions for customers. Team work also has high rank due to in real life, people have to work with each other to finish the given goals. There are 3 high - ranked skills that are not in my required skills, which are organisation skills, writing and troubleshooting.</p>
<img src="capture5.jpg">
<p>The IT - specific skills that are in my required ones are SQL, Javascript and Microsoft Windows. SQL and Javascript are perspectively ranked first and second due to the job requirement. Microsoft Windows has high rank in the chart because in most of the time, the application will run on the Windows OS. There are 3 high - ranked skills that are not in my required skills, which are JAVA, project management and SAP.</p>
<img src="capture6.jpg">
<p>After looking&nbsp;at the Burning Glass data, I decided to change my ideal&nbsp;job&nbsp;to Solution Architect&nbsp;because of its similarity in job description and tasks. Moreover, in recent years, there are too many people learning Software Engineer and still do not have a job, which means the hiring needs are not high.</p>

</u> </p>
<p> Bill Gates does not interact with a few people, he interacts with everyone. When he first started a company, he was worried about his employees because Bill Gates didn't hire a lot of people at the time and all the employees were older than him. Later when he became a philanthropist, he interacted with everyone from investors, everyone related to the relevant field. For instance, Bill Gates is very concerned with US education and he listens to every children's feedback or global health when investing money in vaccines.
</p>
<p> <u> 3. Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time? </u> </p>

<h2> <font color="red"> IT Technologies: </font> </h2>
<b> <u> Block chain and Cryptocurrencies: </u> </b>
<p>
Firstly, Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency and is only available in electronic form. It can only be stored and traded through designated computer or software applications, mobile apps, or through a dedicated digital wallet. Some names of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink. Moreover, all of the above coins are operated on a block chain system and it can be traded as real money out there. Cryptocurrencies can be traded through dedicated and secure networks. In addition, Cryptocurrencies are traded on the block chain network. It also brings new benefits to today's technology industry and the economy. Cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for entrepreneurs or international parties to conduct one-to-one online exchanges without the complications and additional fees that are often associated with relevant international currency exchanges. to a third party. On the other hand, Block chain is the platform that brings electronic money. it is the foundation for creating vehicles of the transaction and enabling the transfer of value and information. The first block chain was invented and designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and realized the following year as a core part of Bitcoin, as block chain technology served as a ledger for all deal. Moreover, Block chains serve as the fundamental underlying technology, of which cryptocurrencies are a part of the ecosystem. They go hand in hand, and cryptocurrencies are often needed to transact on a block chain. But without block chain, we wouldn't have the means for these transactions to be recorded and executed. Cryptocurrencies are traded based on block chain technology, each cryptocurrency transaction is a unique exchange between two parties and protecting users from problems such as identity theft. Besides the current features that block chains and cryptocurrencies can offer, there are many uses beyond cryptocurrencies. Block chains are being used to speed cancer research, improve healthcare record sharing and verify people's identities. As an illustration, a large amount of today's top regulators admit that Block chain plays an important role in the success of the banking industry and financial companies, and in the future, will consider using block chain instead. for the current bank transfer system. Not only provide faster, more cost-effective payment methods. Block chain also helps eliminate intermediaries in transactions, allows people to work directly with each other, improving efficiency in sending and receiving electronic coins. In addition, Block chain uses a distributed ledger that provides banks with a customer identification system, allowing users to verify their identity with just one simple step and allowing banks in the same system to access this stored message. In addition, there are many stores around the world - both online and offline - that accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment. From large online retailers like Overstock and Newegg to local shops, bars, and restaurants. Bitcoins can be used to pay for hotel rooms, book flights, buy jewelry, buy apps, computer equipment, and even a university degree. Currently, there are many other digital currencies emerging such as Litecoin, XRP, Ethereum, but Bitcoin still occupies a unique position in the form of payment. Things are gradually changing when recently, Apple has supported payment of 10 different electronic coins on the App Store. In the same way, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are being extremely appreciated for the potential that it can develop later. Based on a few examples of famous people in the technology industry, such as Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, investor and philanthropist: "Bitcoin is pretty much better than other currencies in that you don't have to be in the same place to make a big transaction, paper money becomes inconvenient." or Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic and more than 400 other businesses: “I think Bitcoin works. There may be other currencies like that and even better. But for the time being, the world is seeing the rise of a huge industry that revolves around Bitcoin - Everyone gets rich from Bitcoin, some also lose money. Bitcoin fluctuates but people can often still make money from those fluctuations.
</p> <br>
<p> Secondly, Cryptocurrencies and block chain there are positive effects because of the profitability of a cryptocurrency. Another benefit of decentralizing cryptocurrencies is that governments cannot regulate them. As a result, the cryptocurrency is not limited to a specific geographic area and can be traded around the world. Hence, Bitcoin can be used to provide low-cost money transfers, especially for those looking to transfer small amounts of money internationally, such as remittance payments (Scott, 2016). These funds can often be transferred cheaper than central bank-issued currencies, because using cryptocurrencies allows for worldwide financial transfers without the need for an intermediary. In addition, the speed of money transfer is increased by eliminating middlemen. However,  the risks and risks that it brings are undeniable. It appeared that these border independent payments also have some negative aspects that need to be considered. For instance, one characteristic is that it makes it easy to transfer money from illegal activities or fund terrorist operations without the possibility of government intervention. Since this is an independent system, it is very difficult for the government to intervene. The security of this technology is one thing the authorities are suffering from. Furthermore, no government or central bank can influence the supply of cryptocurrencies, as the supply is determined by the underlying protocol of the
cryptocurrency. Consequently, no state can influence the cash flow, which limits the power of government. Due to the loss of government power and the threat of terrorism funding, some countries have banned the use of cryptocurrencies, for example Indonesia has banned cryptocurrencies from being used in their own countries.
</p> <br>
<p> Finally, Cryptocurrencies have a positive effect on me personally. The advent of cryptocurrency and its technological value not only help the technology of the world to develop but each individual can be helped. It is possible to make money and trade those virtual currencies by buying at low value and selling at high value. Furthermore, investing in a calculated and non-obligatory way in connection with any intermediary transaction will give you the ability to legally freely execute transactions. But besides that the lack of understanding in this issue is also a danger because its transactions are easy to let you lose your guard, leading to losing money. There are many people who have been fooled. For example, Bitcoinnet two years ago the bitcoinnet opened up investment packages that only required players to invest money and interest would be returned periodically, which was extremely large 30% of their total investment and a lot of people have participated. and the result for those people is a loss of money invested after a short period of time when these investment packages are active. Since the government is unable to participate in this block chain system, the participants' subsequent filing of lawsuits is virtually meaningless. But if we look at the reality of transparent technologies and their utility, it will be very good if their utilities are legally controlled and developed. That would be a huge step forward for trading.
</p> <br>
<p> In short, Cryptocurrencies and block chains are one of the modern technologies and it needs to be developed more explicitly in order to be legally used. More and more convenience will be promoted more and more because today's demands are changing gradually. In my way of thinking, will be a great advantage for those who learn and study more closely about cryptocurrencies and block chains can do in the future.

<p><strong><strong>Cybersecurity</strong></strong></p>
<p>The Internet has become an inseperatable part of current life, from communicating through Facebook and emails to storing large amount of information on Apps such as Google Drive. And with the growing use of the Internet, protecting own computers and important data have become necessary. A computer without approriate security standards is easily by viruses and then all information can be stolen in moments. Every day, there are thousands of malicious websites that are created in order to deceive people to enter, which allows hackers to gain illegal acces to the computer systems. There are some kinds of cybersecurity threats, for instance phishing, ransomware and malware. Phishing is the practice of sending fake emails in order to steal sensitive data such as credit card numbers and password, which is the most common type of cyber attack. Ransomware is the type of malicious software that is used to block access to computer systems or files. The infected computer&rsquo;s owners have to pay a certain amount of money to the hackers in order to get a key to decrypt the software, and it is not guaranteed that paying the ransomware will make the files or systems restored. Malware is the type of software that inject certain kinds of viruses to gain illegal access and cause damage to the computer. These cyber attacks can&nbsp;negatively affect to people&rsquo;s&nbsp;lives that range from minor inconvenience to serious incidents, such as losing confidential data or get financial problems. Therefore, it is crucial that cybersecurity is an essential standard in protecting and preventing personal information from being taken and used unapproriately. Cybersecurity or IT security is defined as all operations and activities that are used to minimize any kind of threats and vulnerabilities, as well as enforcing the mechanisms and processes that protect digital equipment and data. In the current time, there are some counter measurements that can protect own computers and personal data. Firstly is the firewall, a computer mechanism that controls the access of files from one network to the computer&rsquo;s one. The firewall can recognize any kinds of unwanted programs that are stored in the database and then warn users about the kinds of spyware, the impact of those softwares will cause to the computer systems. By turning the firewall on, users have protected themselves from downloading infected files and programs. Secondly is the anti - virus software. These programs are designed to locate and isolate the unwanted spywares, therefore prevent those malicious software from running and steal information, or causing damage to the computer systems. Currently on the market, there are a lot of famous companies that provide good anti - spyware programs, such as BitDefender, MalwareBytes, Avira. Apart from the traditional methods, there are also some advanced ways to protect the computers. Using virtual machine is one of those methods. By creating a separated and completely isolated operating system, users are safe to download and test various kinds of malicious programs and viruses, without worrying the illegal access to the important files inside the other operating system. As the number of softwares, the Internet access, as well as computer and mobile users are growing rapidly, so do the chances of cyber attacks and the techniques of doing the cyber crimes. People will be more aware of the danger of cyber attack and be more careful before clicking to any websites or links on the Internet. Therefore, in the near future, following with the increase of users&rsquo; awareness, it is obvious that the cybersecurity technology will develop at the remarkable speed in order to catch up with the needs of protecting personal information.</p>
<p>Due to the danger and consequences of cyber attack, cybersecurity has become necessary&nbsp;for individuals and families, as well as government organizations&nbsp;and business companies&nbsp;that collect and store&nbsp;on computers a wide range of confidential&nbsp;data&nbsp;from users. For families, protecting&nbsp;family members from cyber crimes&nbsp;has become incredibly&nbsp;important. Children are easy targets for thoses attacks because they do not have full awareness of malicious websites. There are many cases of children using parents&rsquo; digital devices to access infected web pages and then the family gets financial problems due to the personal information leakage. For an individual, protecting information that could affect&nbsp;life as well as personal&nbsp;finance data is essential. The internet provides&nbsp;a wide range&nbsp;of learning opportunities, but there are also risks. Photos, videos and other personal information uploaded&nbsp;by an individual on social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram&nbsp;can be illegally&nbsp;used by hackers may lead to serious troubles. Recently, these&nbsp;sites have become the most popular places&nbsp;for sharing information and connecting with other people&nbsp;around the world. Along with the benefits.&nbsp;the social networking&nbsp;sites have also created opportunities for hackers to do the crimes. Therefore, it is important for users&nbsp;to understand how to protect&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;against cyber threats&nbsp;by using standard measurements and being aware of the danger of data leakage. One should learn how to protect own computers and personal data&nbsp;from being hacked and should have&nbsp;appropriate online behavior in order to minimize&nbsp;chances&nbsp;of cyber threats. The development of cybersecurity technology will create more jobs in the IT field due to the needs of securing data and computer systems of companies and organizations. The cyber attack towards these entities can create immeasurable loss of finance and reputation, which means those companies needs a large amount of human resources in the related field.</p>
<p>In daily life, I think learning more about the cybersecurity will help me a lot in the future. My future job will be involving in the IT field, which means my computer will contain many confidential data about the projects and clients. Leaking the data will not only give me troubles about working productivity but also the reputation of my company that I am working for and clients that they have trust on me. Therefore, it is important for me to set up counter measurements in order to prevent them. Currently, beside using firewall and anti - spyware application, I have also change my online behavior. In the past, I used to click on various kinds of websites without noticing the danger of viruses and spywares until I got ones into the computer systems. It was an extremely bad experience and it took a lot of time and effort to get rid of the viruses. Then I knew about the virtual machine and the advantages of using them while surfing the internet and downloading files. Since then I always use VMWare to set up the virtual environment on my computer before doing anything involving Internet. For me, it is a good habit to protect myself against the cyber attacks which happens every day. Having full awareness of the danger of personal information leakage also help my family members to use the Internet safer. My father works in a big company but he does not know much about the technology, so his laptop contains many files about the contracts and working plans. He is aware of the cyber crimes, therefore he asks me some advises about protecting his laptop and have installed an anti - virus software. Overall, cybersecurity is an essential way that everyone should learn at least the basic concepts in order to protect own digital device from cyber threats from the Internet.</p>

<h2> <font color="red"> Project Ideas: </font> </h2>
<p><mark> <b> Overview:</b> </mark> Overall, this will be a smart and automatic watering project. This project will include the installation of a sprinkler system and temperature sensor system for each area separately. Moreover, this is not only a simple automatic watering project but also includes an analysis of the plant's condition and its growth environment. It will help optimize plant growth and achieve the same results on a large scale. Because of that, such benefits save labor, time and quantity of production will be significantly increased. This will be a technology suitable for Vietnam's environment, it will help farmers and industry of Vietnam to achieve success in the future.
</p>
<p> <mark> <b> Description:</b> </mark> A smart and automatic watering project will have 2 main steps which are to set irrigation and ambient sensor systems. Firstly, the irrigation system will be distributed correctly in each area so that when watering will ensure the amount of water to water the plants in an equal amount. For instance, the installation of an automatic irrigation system for orange trees will be the position between the 4 trees, it will help when watering those 4 orange trees will have an equal amount of water and at the same time of day. Moreover, even if a farm is guaranteed that every tree will have the same watering regime, the quality of the oranges will always be the same and guaranteed. Besides orange trees, all such agricultural produce as vegetables, potatoes and even ornamental plants will have similar results.
</p>
<p> Secondly, ambient sensor systems will also be installed based on application calculations. This system will be placed high above and around the habitat of these trees and all other surrounding areas. Moreover, their task will be to collect information about temperature, light, humidity and wind to give information about the center of the application. Accordingly, according to the data that the application has collected, the programmed system will analyze the status of the trees in each area, which will result in how to provide suitable and timely solutions for trees. On the other hand, after receiving information and analysis from ambient sensor systems, there will be a programmed program for the watering system to adjust the amount of water accordingly (this amount of water will include fertilizer dissolve in water to come). For instance, on dry days, ambient sensor systems will notify the system's main center that the orange tree area is in need of water and this dry environment will directly affect the tree. Based on the analytical information, the irrigation system will be adjusted to irrigate with more water and appropriate fertilizer to help stabilize the orange trees.
</p>
<p> Finally, once the system is complete, its owners can directly view the status of the plants through analysis and reports of ambient sensor systems. Moreover, the user will not need to go directly to the planting area to control the device because the system will be integrated on the system's computer and will grow to be compatible with the phone if the user is not directly located at the computer-controlled position. For example, when the system owner does not need to go to the location of each tree in hot weather but instead in the control area to check everything on the data. In addition, when they have a job they cannot stay on the farm and have to go to another city, they can still connect to the device by phone to control and check the situation of the tree. In short, an intelligent and automatic watering project will be installed with all the information based on the most accurate experts to ensure that there will be no errors in interpreting and adjusting the water volume for suitable.

<h2> <font color="red"> Feedback: </font> </h2>
<p> <b> Le Anh Tuan (3836290): </b> </p>
<p> By the end of week 8 I work completely alone. I have tried to contact all members of the group and do not receive any reply. No one gives an opinion about the job and has no responsibility until now.
</p>

<p> <b> Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269): </b> </p>
<p>The week 8 and week 9 is very bad for me since I have to go to the hospital because of food poisoning. The Wifi in my room is always unavailable so during that time, I can only do the profile part, IT industry and IT work. It was very hard since there is no Internet connection to find good information. It was also my fault for not taking my team members&rsquo; phone number to contact with them. About Le Anh Tuan, he has distributed the work between 3 people fairly and I think he is a responsible person. For Le Tuan Kiet, I did not know much about him since the last group meeting discussing about the assignment.</p>

<h2> <font color="red"> Group Reflection: </font> </h2>
<p> <b> Duong Tuan Nghia (s3818269): </b> </p>
<p>About the Assignment 2, the only thing that went well for me is that I did try my best to finish my work. The food poisoning incident made my performance for assignment a bad experience as it was the first group project. Therefore, I think my communication skills and teamwork need to be improved a lot. One thing made me surprised is that I was able to finish the IT technology part in a short time. One thing that I have learned about groups is that we need to communicate more in order to know the group progression.</p>
